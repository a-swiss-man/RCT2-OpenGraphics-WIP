# RCT2 OpenGraphics WIP

## Description
This repository contains Work-In-Progress (WIP) OpenGraphics rides and shops for OpenRCT2. As I'm learning Blender, many of these models may not be submitted as official OpenGraphics Objects. However, all files are provided here for any 3D artists who wish to modify or improve upon these models.

## Installation
No special installation is required other than having OpenRCT2 installed on your system.

## Usage
1. If a .parkobj file is provided, drag it into your `Documents/OpenRCT2/object` folder.
2. You DO NOT need Blender or the .blend files to use these objects in OpenRCT2.

## Note
Many of these Objects share the same name as RCT2 Objects. To differentiate, all parkobj files have been modified to include 'ASM' before the object name (e.g., 'ASM [objectName]'). This naming convention will remain until potential integration into the OpenGraphics project.

## Contributing
Feel free to use, modify, or improve upon any of the models provided in this repository. Contributions from experienced 3D artists are welcome!
